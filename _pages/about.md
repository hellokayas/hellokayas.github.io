* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) at Northwestern University. I started my PhD at Dartmouth College in Spring 2021, but transferred to Northwestern University, where I started my PhD from fall 2021. 
* I work in Computer Science and my office is on the third floor of [Seeley G. Mudd building](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/libraries-collections/mudd-library/). Currently I work with [Prof. Konstantin Makarychev](https://konstantin.makarychev.net/). Here is a copy of my (maybe not updated) [Curriculum Vitae](https://hellokayas.github.io/files/CV.pdf)
* My primary areas of research is Design and Analysis of algorithms.  I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, and machine learning. I am currently in working on some approximation algorithm problems related to corelation clustering and also problems in combinatorial optimization greatly interest me.
* As secondary interest, I like to mention Few-Shot Learning, theoretical guarantees related to consistency in probabilistic methods and community recoveries in stochastic block models.
* I have completed my PhD(also Masters in CS) course requirements in Fall 2022 and was awarded the Masters degree. I have not completed my PhD qualification exam yet.
* I completed my Masters of Mathematics(MMath) from [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/content/statistics-mathematics), Kolkata, India.
* I completed my undergraduate studies(Bsc dual hons) in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/), India.
* I completed my school education from [South Point High School](https://www.southpoint.edu.in/), Kolkata, India.
* My vernacular is Bengali. I love to play chess in my free time.
